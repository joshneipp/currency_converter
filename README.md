#Currency Converter

##Description

This program converts the value of one currency to its corresponding
value in another currency, based on currency exchange rates stored inside
the program.

For example, a certain quantity of New Zealand Dollars may be converted
to a quantity of euros, or Japanese yen may be converted to British pounds.

##Note

The program as written thus far will not ask for user input. It will simply
demonstrate the conversion of currencies already coded into the program. Anyone
with access to the program code can hard code currencies to be converted.
At the time of the writing of this README, exchange rates were based on
rates from [this website](http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/#rates).
